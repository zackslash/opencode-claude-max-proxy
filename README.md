A transparent proxy that lets you use your **Claude Max subscription** with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) — with full multi-model agent delegation.

## The Idea

OpenCode speaks the Anthropic API. Claude Max gives you unlimited Claude through the [Agent SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk). This proxy bridges the two — but the interesting part isn't the bridging, it's **how tool execution and agent delegation work**.

Most proxy approaches try to handle everything internally: the SDK runs tools, manages subagents, and streams back a finished result. The problem? The SDK only knows about Claude models. If you're using [oh-my-opencode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode) with agents routed to GPT-5.4, Gemini, or other providers, the SDK can't reach them. Your carefully configured multi-model agent setup gets flattened to "everything runs on Claude."

This proxy takes a different approach: **passthrough delegation**. Instead of handling tools internally, the proxy intercepts every tool call *before the SDK executes it*, stops the turn, and forwards the raw `tool_use` back to OpenCode. OpenCode handles execution — including routing `Task` calls through its own agent system with full model routing. The result comes back as a standard `tool_result`, the proxy resumes the SDK session, and Claude continues.

The effect: Claude thinks it's calling tools normally. OpenCode thinks it's talking to the Anthropic API. But behind the scenes, your oracle agent runs on GPT-5.4, your explore agent runs on Gemini, and the main session runs on Claude Max — exactly as configured.

## How Passthrough Works

The key insight is the Claude Agent SDK's `PreToolUse` hook — an officially supported callback that fires before any tool executes. Combined with `maxTurns: 1`, it gives us precise control over the execution boundary:

1. **Claude generates a response** with `tool_use` blocks (Read a file, delegate to an agent, run a command)
2. **The PreToolUse hook fires** for each tool call — we capture the tool name, input, and ID, then return `decision: "block"` to prevent SDK-internal execution
3. **The SDK stops** (blocked tool + maxTurns:1 = turn complete) and we have the full tool_use payload
4. **The proxy returns it to OpenCode** as a standard Anthropic API response with `stop_reason: "tool_use"`
5. **OpenCode handles everything** — file reads, shell commands, and crucially, `Task` delegation through its own agent system with full model routing
6. **OpenCode sends `tool_result` back**, the proxy resumes the SDK session, and Claude continues

No monkey-patching. No forked SDKs. No fragile stream rewriting. Just a hook and a turn limit.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Claude Max subscription** — [Subscribe here](https://claude.ai/settings/subscription)
2. **Claude CLI** authenticated: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code && claude login`
3. **Bun** runtime: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rynfar/opencode-claude-max-proxy
cd opencode-claude-max-proxy
bun install

# Start in passthrough mode (recommended)
CLAUDE_PROXY_PASSTHROUGH=1 bun run proxy
```

### Connect OpenCode

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456 opencode
```

The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` can be any non-empty string — the proxy doesn't use it. Authentication is handled by your `claude login` session.

### Shell Alias

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
alias oc='ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456 opencode'
```

## Modes

### Passthrough Mode (recommended)

```bash
CLAUDE_PROXY_PASSTHROUGH=1 bun run proxy
```

All tool execution is forwarded to OpenCode. This enables:

- **Multi-model agent delegation** — oh-my-opencode routes each agent to its configured model
- **Full agent system prompts** — not abbreviated descriptions, the real prompts
- **OpenCode manages everything** — tools, agents, permissions, lifecycle

### Internal Mode (default)

```bash
bun run proxy
```

Tools execute inside the proxy via MCP. Subagents run on Claude via the SDK's native agent system. Simpler setup, but all agents use Claude regardless of oh-my-opencode config.

| | Passthrough | Internal |
|---|---|---|
| Tool execution | OpenCode | Proxy (MCP) |
| Agent delegation | OpenCode → multi-model | SDK → Claude only |
| oh-my-opencode models | ✅ Respected | ❌ All Claude |
| Agent system prompts | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Description only |
| Setup complexity | Same | Same |

## Works With Any Agent Framework

The proxy extracts agent definitions from the `Task` tool description that OpenCode sends in each request. This means it works automatically with:

- **Native OpenCode** — `build` and `plan` agents
- **oh-my-opencode** — `oracle`, `explore`, `librarian`, `sisyphus-junior`, `metis`, `momus`, etc.
- **Custom agents** — anything you define in `opencode.json`

In internal mode, a `PreToolUse` hook fuzzy-matches agent names as a safety net (e.g., `general-purpose` → `general`, `Explore` → `explore`, `code-reviewer` → `oracle`). In passthrough mode, OpenCode handles agent names directly.

## Session Resume

The proxy tracks SDK session IDs and resumes conversations on follow-up requests:

- **Faster responses** — no re-processing of conversation history
- **Better context** — the SDK remembers tool results from previous turns

Session tracking works two ways:

1. **Header-based** (recommended) — Add the included OpenCode plugin:
   ```json
   { "plugin": ["./path/to/opencode-claude-max-proxy/src/plugin/claude-max-headers.ts"] }
   ```

2. **Fingerprint-based** (automatic fallback) — hashes the first user message to identify returning conversations

Sessions are cached for 24 hours.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_PASSTHROUGH` | (unset) | Enable passthrough mode — forward all tools to OpenCode |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT` | 3456 | Proxy server port |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_HOST` | 127.0.0.1 | Proxy server host |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_WORKDIR` | (cwd) | Working directory for Claude and tools |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_MAX_CONCURRENT` | 1 | Max concurrent SDK sessions (increase with caution) |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 120 | Connection idle timeout |

## Concurrency

The proxy supports multiple simultaneous OpenCode instances. Each request spawns its own independent SDK subprocess — there's no serialization bottleneck. Run as many terminals as you want.

For production use, use the auto-restart supervisor:

```bash
CLAUDE_PROXY_PASSTHROUGH=1 ./bin/claude-proxy-supervisor.sh
```

The Bun runtime occasionally crashes during stream cleanup after concurrent requests complete. All responses are delivered correctly — the crash only happens during post-response cleanup. The supervisor detects this and restarts in ~1 second, so subsequent requests work immediately.

## Model Mapping

| OpenCode Model | Claude SDK |
|----------------|------------|
| `anthropic/claude-opus-*` | opus |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-*` | sonnet (default) |
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-*` | haiku |

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why passthrough mode instead of handling tools internally?</strong></summary>

Internal tool execution means the SDK handles everything — but the SDK only speaks Claude. If your agents are configured for GPT-5.4 or Gemini via oh-my-opencode, that routing gets lost. Passthrough mode preserves the full OpenCode agent pipeline, including multi-model routing, full system prompts, and agent lifecycle management.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this work without oh-my-opencode?</strong></summary>

Yes. Both modes work with native OpenCode (build + plan agents) and with any custom agents defined in your `opencode.json`. oh-my-opencode just adds more agents and model routing — the proxy handles whatever OpenCode sends.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do I need ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy?</strong></summary>

OpenCode requires an API key to be set, but the proxy never uses it. Authentication is handled by your `claude login` session through the Agent SDK.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about rate limits?</strong></summary>

Your Claude Max subscription has its own usage limits. The proxy doesn't add any additional limits. Concurrent requests are supported.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data sent anywhere else?</strong></summary>

No. The proxy runs locally. Requests go directly to Claude through the official SDK. In passthrough mode, tool execution happens in OpenCode on your machine.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does internal mode use MCP tools?</strong></summary>

The Claude Agent SDK uses different parameter names for tools than OpenCode (e.g., `file_path` vs `filePath`). Internal mode provides its own MCP tools with SDK-compatible parameter names. Passthrough mode doesn't need this since OpenCode handles tool execution directly.
</details>

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Authentication failed" | Run `claude login` to authenticate |
| "Connection refused" | Make sure the proxy is running: `bun run proxy` |
| "Port 3456 is already in use" | `kill $(lsof -ti :3456)` or use `CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT=4567` |
| Title generation fails | Set `"small_model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"` in your OpenCode config |
